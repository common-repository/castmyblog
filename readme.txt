Requires at least: 3.0
Tested up to: 3.0.1
Stable tag: 1.1


== Description ==

When you create a new post, it is automatically converted to audio using text to speech technology, and a podcast-compatible link is inserted into your post. It's all automatic - no messing around with settings and configurations.

Please note that a short tag line about this service will be added on to the end of your MP3.

The plugin only inserts a link to the MP3 and sets the enclosure for Podcasting. If you want to have a nice, pretty player I recommend you install the Blubrry PowerPress podcasting plugin, which comes with your own player and lets you customize other podcasting options like your feed description and logo. 
Any plugin which turns a MP3 enclosure to a player should work. 

What happens after I click Post?

*   Your post contents are sent to the server and put into an encoding queue
*   The text is automagically converted to MP3 audio
*   The first time your post is viewed, the URL of the MP3 is grabbed from the server
*   From then on, the MP3 URL is cached, to increase performance.
*   30 days later, the file expires and is deleted. 

This is a BETA service. We are still ironing out all of the wrinkles, so please don't be surprised if it stops working for short periods of time! We assume no responsibility for any problems you may encounter running this BETA NON PRODUCTION service.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How do I make it work? =

Simply install the plugin and activate it. Everything else is Autiomatic! Yay for simple!

= Who owns the MP3's and the content? =

You do - you retain any and all copyrights on the content you create. However, in order to use the service you must allow us to make a copy of the content in our database, convert it to another form (MP3), add a short tag line on the end, and host the MP3 file on our server. 

= How can I remove the tag line at the end of the MP3 =

Soon we will be offering a premium service which will allow you to remove the tag line and add your own intro and outro. Check http://castmyblog.com for updates.

= How can I keep my MP3's longer than 30 days? =

Soon we will be offering a premium service which will allow you keep your MP3's for a much longer time. 
The MP3's are also yours, during the 30 days that they are hosted on our servers you can download them and upload them to your own server.
